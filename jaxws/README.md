# jaxws

This module contains code for labs ``lab1`` to ``lab3`` (both inclusive), i.e. the ``JAX-WS`` labs.

There are ``server`` and ``client`` submodules.

* Server provides standalone web service application which is bootstrapped from the ``App`` class.
* Client provides web service client code generated with ``wsimport``.

``client`` module also contains unit test to check the lab's requirements.
