# jaxws

This module contains code for labs ``lab1`` to ``lab3`` (both inclusive), i.e. the ``JAX-WS`` labs.

There are ``server`` and ``client`` submodules.

* Server module provides standalone web service application which is bootstrapped from the ``App`` class.
* Client module contains unit tests to check the lab's requirements. WSDL and web service client code are generated using ``jaxws-maven-plugin`` plugin.
